# ping_with_sonar_effect
A python program for the mood of submarine feeling under the water of net

From a programmer perspective, there is nothing original in this short program. My aim was something other, namely, to create a program which can give you an acoustic feeling. Using ping in the command line it is an ordinary event, but using ping with an acoustic effect, as if web were an ocean where the hosts are the things we could explore with a sonar, now, it may be an interesting scene, and a new experience. Let's try it!
